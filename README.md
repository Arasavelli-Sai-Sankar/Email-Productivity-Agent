Email Productivity Agent

## Project Title:

Email Productivity Agent

## Important Clarification

This project was fully designed and developed by me using React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and Gemini API integration.

Gemini AI Studio was used **only for generating the API key** required to access the Gemini model. The application logic, UI design, workflow, and implementation were entirely built manually and not generated using Gemini AI Studio or any auto-code generation platform.

The Email Productivity Agent is an AI-powered web application that helps users efficiently manage and analyze emails. It provides intelligent features such as summarization, action item extraction, and automated reply drafting using Gemini AI.

The system is designed to improve productivity by reducing the time spent reading and responding to emails.
